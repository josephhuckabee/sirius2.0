    <h1>Where do we live?</h1>
    <p>Earth is located in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way (called the Orion Arm) which lies about two-thirds of the way out from the center of the Galaxy. Here we are part of the Solar System — a group of eight planets, as well as numerous comets and asteroids and dwarf planets which orbit the Sun. The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter.</p>

    <h2>Our galactic neighborhood</h2>
    <p>The four inner system planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four giant planets of the outer system are substantially larger and more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have nearly circular orbits that lie close to the plane of the Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic.</p>

    <h2>Our celestial neighbors</h2>
  </div>

<section class="grid4">
  <div class="planet">
    <h3>Mercury</h3>
    <h6>Structure and surface</h6>
    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It is a terrestrial planet: small and rocky. Mercury doesn't really have an atmosphere.</p>
    <h6>Time on Mercury</h6>
    <p>A day on Mercury lasts 59 Earth days. A year on Mercury lasts 88 Earth days.</p>
    <h6>Quick history</h6>
    <p>Mercury has been known since ancient times because it can be seen without advanced telescopes. Mercury has been visited by two spacecraft: Mariner 10 and MESSENGER.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="planet">
    <h3>Venus</h3>
    <h6>Structure and surface</h6>
    <p>Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. It is a terrestrial planet, small and rocky. Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat and makes the planet very hot. It has an active surface, including volcanoes, and spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets.</p>
    <h6>Time on Venus</h6>
    <p>A day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days. A year on Venus lasts 225 Earth days.</p>
    <h6>Quick history</h6>
    <p>Venus has been known since ancient times because it can be seen easily without a telescope. Venus has been visited by several spacecraft: Mariner 2, Mariner 5, Mariner 10, Pioneer Venus 1, Pioneer Venus 2, and an orbiter called Magellan.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="planet">
    <h3>Earth</h3>
    <h6>Structure and surface</h6>
    <p>Earth is a terrestrial planet. Its atmosphere is the right thickness to keep the planet warm so living things like us can be there. It’s the only planet in our solar system we know of that supports life. It is mostly nitrogen, and it has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe.</p>
    <h6>Time on Earth</h6>
    <p>A day on Earth lasts a little under 24 hours. One year on Earth lasts 365.25 days. That 0.25 extra means every four years we add one day to our calendar, called a leap day.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="planet">
    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <h6>Structure and surface</h6>
    <p>Mars is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky. Mars has a thin atmosphere. Its volcanoes are dead, but it has an active atmosphere.</p>
    <h6>Time on Mars</h6>
    <p>One day on Mars lasts 24.6 hours. One year on Mars is 687 Earth days.</p>
    <h6>Quick history</h6>
    <p>Mars has been known since ancient times because it can be seen without advanced telescopes. Several missions have visited Mars, and Mars is the only planet we have sent rovers to.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="planet">
    <h3>Jupiter</h3>
    <h6>Structure and surface</h6>
    <p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It is a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has a very thick atmosphere and faint rings.</p>
    <h6>Time on Jupiter</h6>
    <p>One day on Jupiter goes by in just 10 hours. One year on Jupiter is the same as 11.8 Earth years.</p>
    <h6>Quick history</h6>
    <p>Jupiter has been known since ancient times because it can be seen without advanced telescopes. Jupiter has been visited or passed by several spacecraft, such as Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Cassini, New Horizons, and Juno.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="planet">
    <h3>Saturn</h3>
    <h6>Structure and surface</h6>
    <p>Saturn is a gas giant like Jupiter. It is made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a thick atmosphere and a lovely set of rings with gaps between them.</p>
    <h6>Time on Saturn</h6>
    <p>One day on Saturn goes by in just 10.7 hours. One year on Saturn is the same as 29 Earth years.</p>
    <h6>Quick history</h6>
    <p>Saturn has been known since ancient times because it can be seen without advanced telescopes. Four robotic spacecraft have visited Saturn, including Pioneer 11, Cassini, and Voyager 1 and 2.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="planet">
    <h3>Uranus</h3>
    <h6>Structure and surface</h6>
    <p>Uranus is surrounded by a set of 13 rings. It is an ice giant, made of flowing icy materials above a solid core. Uranus has a thick atmosphere of methane, hydrogen, and helium. It is the only planet that spins on its side and spins opposite the direction of Earth and most other planets.</p>
    <h6>Time on Uranus</h6>
    <p>One day on Uranus lasts a little over 17 hours. One year on Uranus is the same as 84 years on Earth.</p>
    <h6>Quick history</h6>
    <p>Uranus was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel in Great Britain. Uranus has only been visited by Voyager 2.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="planet">
    <h3>Neptune</h3>
    <h6>Structure and surface</h6>
    <p>Neptune is encircled by six rings. Like Uranus, it is an ice giant made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane flowing over a solid core about the size of Earth. Neptune has a thick, windy atmosphere.</p>
    <h6>Time on Neptune</h6>
    <p>One day on Neptune goes by in 16 hours. Neptune takes 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun.</p>
    <h6>Quick history</h6>
    <p>Neptune was discovered in 1846 by Urbain Le Verrier, John Couch Adams, and Johann Galle. Only Voyager 2 has visited Neptune.</p>
