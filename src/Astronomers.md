    <h4>Galileo Galilei</h4>
    <p>Born in Pisa in Italy in 1564, Galileo was a great scientist and astronomer who developed modern astronomy. He has been credited as the father on modern science. Galileo has also been credited with the Law of Constant Acceleration; however what Galileo is most famous for is the invention of the first space telescope by taking the design of the existing land telescope and making it more powerful. Galileo started to study and discover the stars, and while studying Jupiter he discovered that Jupiter had 4 main moons that hadn’t been discovered before. These moons are now called Galilean Moons. Galileo also made great discoveries of Venus and Earth’s moon, but a lot of people disagreed with Galileo, and like Copernicus people didn’t believe his ideas and theories. His work however has stood the test of time, with many of his theories proven fact.</p>

    <h4>Johannes Kepler</h4>
    <p>Born in Weil Der Stadt in Germany in 1571, Kepler was first and foremost a famous mathematician and later a famous astronomer who believed very much so in Copernicus’s ideas that the planets revolved around the sun and not the Earth. And with that he also went one theory further and through much study stated that not only do the planets revolve around the sun but that they revolve around the sun in an oval shape called an elliptical orbit. This was one of the 3 laws of planetary motion that made Johannes Kepler so well known. Later in life, Johannes Kepler also studied law and become a lawyer. Kepler was a very intelligent man like all scientists and was a man of many talents.</p>

    <h4>Sir Isaac Newton</h4>
    <p>Born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire England, Newton was a renowned professor of mathematics of the university of Cambridge. Newton is one of the pioneers of astronomy, and is largely credited with the discovery of gravity, and also the theories on the laws of motion, which is F=MA. Newton is said to have discovered gravity when he watched an apple falling from a tree, where he connected that the apple coming from the tree and hitting the ground was due to the force of gravity.</p>

    <h4>Albert Einstein</h4>
    <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".</p>

    <h4>Edwin Hubble</h4>
    <p>A famous American astronomer, who was born in Missouri, US in 1889. Hubble discovered that the universe was expanding at an astronomical rate beyond our own galaxy. The discovery is now known as Hubble’s Law. Hubble received his first telescope at the age of eight, and began to discover space for himself. And it is so important that he did, as Hubble has become one of the most influential astronomers in history through his very important work. So important, that the famous Hubble telescope was named after the great man.</p>

    <h4>Carl Sagan</h4>
    <p>His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space, the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the hypothesis, accepted since, that the high surface temperatures of Venus can be attributed to, and calculated using, the greenhouse effect. He testified to the US Congress in 1985 that the greenhouse effect would change the earth's climate system.</p>

    <h4>Stephen Hawking</h4>
    <p>Hawking worked primarily in the field of general relativity and particularly on the physics of black holes. In 1971 he suggested the formation, following the big bang, of numerous objects containing as much as one billion tons of mass but occupying only the space of a proton. These objects, called mini black holes, are unique in that their immense mass and gravity require that they be ruled by the laws of relativity, while their minute size requires that the laws of quantum mechanics apply to them also.</p>

    <h4>Immanuel Kant</h4>
    <p>Immanuel Kant (22 April 1724 – 12 February 1804) was a German philosopher and one of the central Enlightenment thinkers. Born in Königsberg, Kant's comprehensive and systematic works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him an influential figure in modern Western philosophy.</p>

    <h4>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</h4>
    <p>Gottfried Wilhelm (von) Leibniz (1 July 1646 – 14 November 1716) was a German polymath active as a mathematician, philosopher, scientist, and diplomat. He is one of the most prominent figures in both the history of philosophy and the history of mathematics. He wrote works on philosophy, theology, ethics, politics, law, history, and philology.</p>

    <h4>René Descartes</h4>
    <p>René Descartes (31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, scientist and lay Catholic who invented analytic geometry, linking the previously separate fields of geometry and algebra. He spent a large portion of his working life in the Dutch Republic, initially serving the Dutch States Army of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange and the Stadtholder of the United Provinces. One of the most notable intellectual figures of the Dutch Golden Age, Descartes is also widely regarded as one of the founders of modern philosophy.</p>
